# HTTP library
Minimal implementation of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocols.

## What this module is and isn't
For now, this module is solely meant for making HTTP requests,
NOT for making an HTTP server. An HTTP server implementation may
be coming, but for now I think HTTP requests are more universally
useful. They enable a programmer to interact with a whole host of
online services, making Onyx more powerful for application development.
