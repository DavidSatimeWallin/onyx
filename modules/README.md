# Modules

These are the modules that current ship with the compiler, but are not
part of the "core" libraries. In the far-future, these modules will be
obtained from a dedicated package manager shipped with the compiler,
and will be downloaded from a central repository. It seems too ambious
to do that work right now, so I am holding off on starting that process
until I have other people producing code and libraries for Onyx.
