# Onyx (WIP)
A simple, small, yet powerful language for WebAssembly.

## Project Goals
This project was started for me to learn the ins and outs of compiler and programming language design.
I do not intend for this language to be used for anything "professional".
It is purely for me to learn and experiment with compiler architecture.
To ensure I have completed achieve what I set out for, I will implement a simple HTML5 game with all game logic and rendering in Onyx.

## TODO
This a small list of things I want in the language when all is said and done. Many more features will be added to this list.

| Progress | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| Completed | Simple locals in functions |
| Completed | Orthogonal define/assign mutable/constant syntax |
| Completed | Top-level function declarations only |
| Completed | Static symbol resolution where order does not matter |
| Completed | Link to externally defined functions (WASM imports) |
| In Progress | Standard C-style control flow |
| Not Started | Pointers |
| Not Started | Structured data |
