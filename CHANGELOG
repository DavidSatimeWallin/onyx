Release v0.0.5
--------------
Additions:
* array literals; use (type).[ (vals) ] as the syntax; They work as global variables, and
    local variables, and as intermediates (such as function arguments).
* polymorphic procedures can be instantiated in many more places now due to clean up.
* added #context_scope block. It automatically stores and restores the context at the beginning
    and the end of the block respectively.
* 'use' statements work on pointers to structures.
* '--fun' flag displays a bar graph of where each of the entities in the compilation
    pipeline are. Compiles the program slower purely to make it look better.
* --verbose prints statistics about the compilation including time taken, lines
    processed and token processed.
* 'abs' function in core/math.onyx.
* 'read_word' in core.string.reader.
* Better error reporting for invaild binary operators.

Removals:
* field accesses on things that are not lvals. This was a bug anyway, so it
    should not require any code changes, but the feature is gone.
* i32map, strmap, ptrmap modules. Use generic map in map.onyx instead.

Changes:
* BREAKING: The type name 'string', and the package name 'str', have been swapped.
* 'use' statements are more powerful. 'use package' can occur at any scope level,
    and 'use <value>' can occur at file scope.
* struct literals can now have arbitrary package prefixes on them, i.e.
    some.deeply.nested.packages.Struct.{ ... };
* struct literals can have arbitrary expressions as their type, i.e.
    (#type [] void).{ ... };
* cleaned up CLI
* assignment over an array type copies the array instead of just the pointer.

Bug fixes:
* globals that were #foreign caused several bugs, which have been squashed.
* field accesses can only happen on lvals.
* Bitwise NOT on unsigned integers did not work.
* 'use' statements now work in polymorphic procedures
* resizing heap allocated memory at the end of memory would not grow underlying memory.
* stack position variables introduced from for loops, ifs, whiles, or switchs would produce
    very bad side effects if they were not in a stack based function.
* array.remove was broken when the semantics of `for: lo .. hi` changed.


Release v0.0.4
--------------
Additions:
* Ability to pass complicated structs by value. Very useful in polymorphic data types.
* bitwise not operator, ~
* auto cast operator, ~~. In many circumstances, will automatically determine what to cast to.
    - Will also report errors in the cast is not possible.
* Arbitrarily typed varargs. They behave similar to C-style varargs.
* vararg_get builtin procedure to retrieve a value from a ... vararg.
* #private_file directive for placing a symbol at file scope.
* a basic implentation of printf in the standard library.
* use statements at the function level.
* nested packages, i.e. 'core.array'
    - Still testing it out; could change at in the future
* basic printf implementation
* core.str.reader library

Removals:

Changes:
* Massive renaming of packages, since nested packages are now allowed.
    - Most collections of function simply were put into a package, instead of being prefixed,
        i.e. array_map -> array.map
* Numeric literals now no longer have a concrete type; they become whatever type is needed,
    reporting an error if that is not possible.
* Procedure definitions now require parentheses, even if there are no arguments. This was
    done to allow for `proc { foo, bar }` to be the overload syntax.
* array.map takes an arbitrary parameter of polymorphic type to make up for the fact that
    anonymous procs do not have closure. New type signature is:
        array_map :: proc (arr: ^[..] $T, data: $R, f: proc (T, R) -> T)
* better syntax highlighting for VIM.
* Compiler internals changed to make it easier to do advanced things in the future. 

Bug fixes:
* many bugs related to var args and procedure calls in general.
* polymorphic structs caused segmentation fault when trying to produce an error message.
* polymorhpic structs caused scope to change when using a struct literal of a polymoprhic type.
* #char "\"" did not work.
* nested function calls returning non-basic types would simply be wrong.
* Recursive structs are no longer possible.
* For loop array/slice/dynarray used to use signed indicies, which was wrong.



Release v0.0.3
--------------
Additions:
* Added polymorphic structs.
* Added polymorphic structs to polymorphic pattern matching.
* Added I32Map polymorphic structure to core library.
* Added println to core library; print followed by a newline.
* Added tests/ folder and runtests.sh which will compile and execute the programs in the
    folder and test against their expected output.
* #private_file for specifying symbols at the file scope.

Removals:

Changes:
* BREAKING: 'use package' now places included symbols at the file scope, not package scope.
* Switched to using TCC as the primary compiler, while maintaining support for GCC.
* boolean literals are compile time known so they can be used at top level.
* #file_contents now results in [] u8, not *u8.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed error message index for struct literal member type mismatch.
* Added struct member name in struct literal member type mismatch.
* Fixed freeing non-allocated memory when generating documentation.
* Fixed alignment issue with struct members.
