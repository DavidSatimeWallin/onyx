Release v0.0.4
--------------
Additions:
* Ability to pass complicated structs by value. Very useful in polymorphic data types.
* bitwise not operator, ~
* auto cast operator, ~~. In many circumstances, will automatically determine what to cast to.
    - Will also report errors in the cast is not possible.

Removals:

Changes:
* Procedure definitions now require parentheses, even if there are no arguments. This was
    done to allow for `proc { foo, bar }` to be the overload syntax.

Bug fixes:



Release v0.0.3
--------------
Additions:
* Added polymorphic structs.
* Added polymorphic structs to polymorphic pattern matching.
* Added I32Map polymorphic structure to core library.
* Added println to core library; print followed by a newline.
* Added tests/ folder and runtests.sh which will compile and execute the programs in the
    folder and test against their expected output.
* #private_file for specifying symbols at the file scope.

Removals:

Changes:
* BREAKING: 'use package' now places included symbols at the file scope, not package scope.
* Switched to using TCC as the primary compiler, while maintaining support for GCC.
* boolean literals are compile time known so they can be used at top level.
* #file_contents now results in [] u8, not *u8.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed error message index for struct literal member type mismatch.
* Added struct member name in struct literal member type mismatch.
* Fixed freeing non-allocated memory when generating documentation.
* Fixed alignment issue with struct members.
