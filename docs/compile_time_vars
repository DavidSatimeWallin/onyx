With the recent addition of compile time if statements, there should be a set of variables
that give information about the current compilation. These would include things such as:
	- Chosen backend (JS, WASI, others in the future)
	- 32-Bit pointers are enabled

The standard library will be rewritten to use these variables to conditionally include file
that are only supported on a particular system.

For the moment, I think that the choice of backend will be given by compiler flags. It will
set the variables described below to their value.

There should be an #error directive that when hit just produces a compile time error and prevents
compilation. It would be useful to ensure certain files that are only for a particular
backend will not compile with the wrong one, such as webgl.onyx.
