Thoughts about the CLI for Onyx
-------------------------------

Right now, unless a specific argument is recognized, it is treated as a file to add to the compilation.
This has worked well, but as the amount of functionality that is being added to the compiler is increasing,
the need for a better CLI system is imminent.

Here are all the things the compiler should be able to do:
    * Compile a file or a set of files
    * Validate a file or set of files
        - Everything done in compilations
        - No outputting to final WASM file
    * Generate documentation for a compilation
        - In Human, Tags, or Html format
    * Print a help menu



  $ onyx compile progs/poly_test.onyx -I other_folder

  $ onyx doc progs/poly_test.onyx --format tag
