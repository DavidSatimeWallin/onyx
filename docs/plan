The ONYX Programming Language
-----------------------------

WHAT:
	ONYX is a low-ish level programming language designed for use with
	Web-Assembly 32-bit (WASM). It features some advanced features such
	as comptime code execution and JS literals for external functions.

WHY:
	ONYX was made to help me learn about compiler design.

FEATURES:
	- Strong type system
	- Smart package loading
	- Structs and enums
	- functions (no anonymous functions)
	- Control structures
		if, for, switch
	- pointers
	- inferred typing
	- defer
	? polymorphic functions

EXAMPLE CODE:

// This is a comment
// This is also the only way to do comments

use "core"; // Looks for "core.onyx" in the current directory

Foo :: struct { x: i32, y: i32 };

export add :: (a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
	return a + b;	
};

foo :: (a: i32) -> Foo {
	return Foo { x = a, y = 0 };
}

MVP CODE:

// Comments need to be parsed

export add :: (a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
	return a + b;
}

export max :: (a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
	// Curly braces are required
	if a > b {
		return a;
	} else {
		return b;
	}
}
