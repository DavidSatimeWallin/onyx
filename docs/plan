The ONYX Programming Language
-----------------------------

WHAT:
	ONYX is a low-ish level programming language designed for use with
	Web-Assembly 32-bit (WASM). It features some advanced features such
	as comptime code execution and JS literals for external functions.

WHY:
	ONYX was made to help me learn about compiler design.

END GOAL:
	ONYX will be used to make a simple-ish game for the browser that leverages
	WASM and WebGL for a performant experience. Language design will reflect the
	needs of the game programming.

FEATURES:
	- Strong type system
	- functions (no anonymous functions)
	- Structs and enums
	- Control structures
		if, for, switch
	- pointers
	- inferred typing
	- Smart package loading
	- defer
	? polymorphic functions

HOW:
	Currently there is a multi-phase development process since implementing everything
	at once would be overwhelming and unsatisfying. The current progress of each stage:

	Stage 1 (MVP):
		[X] Can declare procedures
		[X] Procedures have params and returns of the following types:
			- i32, u32
			- i64, u64
			- f32, f64
		[X] Procedures have locals of the same set of types
		[X] Locals are declared in the following way
			local : (type) ((= or :) initial value);

			if : is used, the value is unmodifiable
			if type is specified, that is assumed to be the correct type
			if type is not specified, the type of initial value is used as the type

		[X] Five basic math operations are legal:
			+ - * / %
		[X] Math operations are sign aware and only operate on operands of the same type
		[X] All casts are explicit using this syntax:
			X as T

			casts X to type T

		[X] Curly braces are required for all bodies of blocks
		[ ] Numeric literals are parsed
		[ ] Numeric literals have the minimum type detected (automatically upcasts)
		[ ] Comparison operators
		[ ] Proper boolean type
		[ ] Conditional branching works as expected
		[ ] Simple while loop is functioning as expected
		[ ] break and continue semantics
		[ ] Function calling works for the builtin types
		[ ] Function return values are type checked

	Stage 2:
		[ ] Order of symbol declaration is irrelevant
			Either:
			make a graph of symbol dependencies and produce a schedule on the graph
			that would allow for all symbols to be resolved

			OR

			Do as many passes on the parse tree as needed to resolve all symbols.
			This could be slow but it would be easier than creating a graph
			scheduling algorithm.

		[ ] Devise and implement a simple set of implicit type casting rules.
			- Numeric literals always type cast to whatever type is needed (very flexible).

		[ ] Strings should work as pointers to data.
			- Literals should be placed in data section with pointers to the start.
			- Should strings be null-terminated or a length at the start of the string?

		[ ] Start work on evaluating compile time known values.
			- An expression marked COMPTIME will be reduced to its value in the parse tree.
