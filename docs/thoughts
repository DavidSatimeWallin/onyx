Memory design:
    - Pointers will work very similar to how they do in C
        - A pointer is a u32
        - Pointers will be notated:
            ^u32  <- Pointer to u32

        - Pointer operations will be:
            * will take the address of a value
                - This operation will not be defined well for a while
                - You can't take the address of a local since it doesn't exist in memory

            << will take the value out of a pointer

            Example use:
            {{{
                ptr: ^i32 = 0; // Address starting at 0
                ptr_ptr := ^ptr;
            }}}
