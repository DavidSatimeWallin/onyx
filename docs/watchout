Some tags to watch out for in the code with features that may be removed in the future:

    :ValueDirectiveHack
        In the same way #type can be used to express a type expression
        in a value context, #value can be used to express a value expression
        in a type context, such as a #solidify directive.

    :NullProcHack
        There are many times where being able to store a procedure that
        is 'null' is useful, such as a vtable-like structure that doesn't
        need all members defined. For this reason, `null_proc` was added.
        It type matches against all procedure types without an error, allowing
        it to be used wherever a procedure was expected. Also, before calling
        a dynamic procedure, it should be checked against `null_proc`.

        The implementation of `null_proc` is rather simple, but feels a
        little verbose an targential compared to everything else being done
        in the compiler.

    :TypeValueInterchange
        Angle brackets are being used to specify types in value expressions
        and vice versa. This is just a temporary hack. The long term goal
        is that type expressions are automatically detected in value
        expressions.
