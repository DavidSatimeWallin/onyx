Some optimizations to make to the output WASM:
    [ ] local.set followed by local.get turns into local.tee
    [ ] Dead code elimination
        - Function level: If a function is not explicitly called or exported, it may be removed
        - Local level: If a local is not read, it may be removed
    [ ] Add compile-time evaluation for simple operations
    [ ] If statement compile-time condition evaluation
        - If the condition of an if statement is compile time known, only generate the case that
            is used
    [ ] Inline-ing functions that have been explicitly marked
