High-Level Goals

There are many ideas  that are wizzing around my head
when I think about the future of Onyx, and I'm having
a hard-time deciding  what needs to be done and when.
I think writing everything out and creating a (rough)
timeline will  be beneficial to me  and the future of
the language.
