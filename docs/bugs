List of known bugs:

[ ] Enum parsing causes segfaults if the syntax is not EXACTLY what is expected. Some cases that break:
    enum { Foo, Bar, Baz };
    enum { Foo; Bar; Baz };

[ ] Aliasing in many cases does not work. For example:
    
    SomeNamespace :: struct {
        foo :: () { ... }
        bar :: ...
    }

    {
        SN :: SomeNamespace

        SN.foo()
    }

List of things to change:
[ ] Currently, there is no way to use the initialized members of a structure without using a struct literal.
    There should be a initialize intrinsic procedure that takes a pointer to anything and initializes it.
    For example:

    initialize :: (x: ^$T) -> void #intrinsic ---

    Foo :: struct {
        x := 1;
        y : f32;
    }

    x : Foo;
    initialize(^x);

    // x.x = 1
    // x.y = <uninitialized>

[ ] Anonymous struct, enum and array literals.
