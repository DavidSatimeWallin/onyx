                        The Onyx Standard Library
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through Onyx has only one compilation target, WebAssembly 32-bit, there are
fundamentally two different use cases: in a browser, or with WASI. Both of
these use cases are to be treated as equally important. To accommodate for
their very different runtimes, a common standard library must be established
that they can share the functionality.

The standard high level topics to cover are:
	- standard output
	- allocation
	- standard math functions
	- strings
	- files
	- utility functions
		* random
		* clock
